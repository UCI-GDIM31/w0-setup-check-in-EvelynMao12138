# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Evelyn Mao, she/her. I'm more interested in games like Read Dead and Undertale, which has good story lines and interesting characters. I also play some souls-like games, but not much. Overally, I enjoy games with slow pace and not too competitive. I attended some gamejams before, but they are all male-oriented, so I wish I can learn coding so that I can make my own game. I hope to build a game with interesting story and has some deep meanings.
2.  - [√ ] Other (U/U switching to GDIM)

3. Learn some basic coding skills, because I have no programming backgrounds, or at lease be able to make some pixel games and know whether something is feasible to acheive in programming. XD
4. Cooperating with classmates. I'm worried about whether I have to obey someone's ideas and do works for them. I tend to prefer making my own game, even if it looks dumb and simple. I was a little traumatized by the past few gamejams and I don't want to be the 2d artist anymore. Not only because I didn't have my drawing skills improved, but also because I have no chance to engage in world-building and construction of mechanisms.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. N/A

2. Unreal, but still learning

3. N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Is it like a google doc that people can work together and brainstorm ideas for games?

2. N/A

3. N/A

4. Is it character-based or plot based games?

5. N/A
